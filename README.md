# STL implementations  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/amarin15/stl_implementations.svg?token=Sixm9dAdgNAi8nS7fenD&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/amarin15/stl_implementations)

This repo was created with an educational purpose in mind, so use at your own risk. That being said, the header-only implementations cover most of their STL interfaces and their APIs have been fully tested using gtest. They avoid complexities such as allocators or hints so that they're easier to follow.

Currently implemented:
- `unordered_map` using chaining
